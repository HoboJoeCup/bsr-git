# BSR Git
Git introductory project for BSR students.

### Preliminary
Be ready to use **command-line**. That said, I leave you complete freedom of
choice when it comes to selecting Git tools. If using GUI plug-in to your
beloved code editor is what best suits your workflow - I'm totally cool with
that. However keep in mind that all resources provided with this tutorial will
refer to bare Git commands. Your interface of choice may - or may not -
implement all features necessary to achieve what you want.

My recommendation is to stick to bare Git command-line tool. Besides forcing the
user to be more focused on what he or she actually does (and not mindlessly
clicking GUI buttons), dealing with command-line interface may just be an
enlightening experience for those of you who got stuck in some [feature overloaded IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

Before you start to actually start coding and using Git:
1. **Read** chapters 1. to 3. from [Git Pro Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) to get the basic idea of how Git works.
2. **Install** Git on your working rig. Basic installation process is covered in [chapter 1.5](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) of Git Pro Book.
3. Take a look at [a guide to writing commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and [Gitflow overview](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). Keep these links under your pillow! Or just bookmark them.

### Task
Programming task coming only after you request it with a specific issue on
GitHub. Note that issues are not part of Git suite. They're feature provided by
GitHub to help collaborate on code. Issues are sort of a message board for
developers - each issue being a specific problem or feature to discuss.
Messages can directly refer to some Git/GitHub entities like commits.

So, what can you do to move forward with Git?

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. Use [issue section](https://github.com/fkrynitzky/bsr-git/issues) to add new issue requesting me to describe your task. If such issue already exists, mark your presence there by posting a comment or reacting to existing comments.

### FAQ
*Why English?*
We agreed to write documentation of our target project in English. Let's start
practicing now.
